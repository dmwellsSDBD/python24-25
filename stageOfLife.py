1. The programming will ask the user to input their name and then input their age. 
2.The program will then print out Hello to <that person's name>. 
3. In a second print statement, based on their age, the program will then print out "You are currently in the _________________ stage of your life."

Criteria and stages:  childhood (8-12 years of age), a teenager (13 - 19 years of age), a young adult (20 - 29 years of age), an adult (30 - 55 years of age), a wise person (56 - 65 years of age), retirement (66 - 100).
